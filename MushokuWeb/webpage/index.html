    <div class="artikel">
        <p class="font paraArtikel">"Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation" is often hailed as the first modern isekai anime due to its significant contributions to the genre, both in terms of popularizing new tropes and setting higher standards for storytelling. While isekai stories—those featuring characters transported to or reborn in another world—have existed for decades, "Mushoku Tensei" introduced several elements that have since become defining characteristics of the genre.
        </p>
            <h3 class="font">Pioneering Influence on Modern Isekai Tropes</h3>
            <p class="font paraArtikel"> of the primary reasons "Mushoku Tensei" is considered the first modern isekai is its role in popularizing the reincarnation premise. Although reincarnation themes were not new, this series helped cement the concept of a protagonist being reborn in another world while retaining memories of their past life. This idea of starting anew with prior knowledge and experience provided a fresh take and opened up various narrative possibilities, including the chance for significant character growth and the exploration of past regrets and future aspirations.
            
            The series is also lauded for its detailed world-building. Unlike many earlier isekai stories that often relied on familiar fantasy tropes without much depth, "Mushoku Tensei" takes great care in constructing a rich, immersive world. This includes a well-defined history, diverse cultures, intricate magic systems, and detailed geography. This comprehensive approach to world-building has set a new standard for subsequent isekai series, encouraging creators to develop more engaging and believable settings.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font">Character Development and Depth</h3>
            <p class="font">Another significant contribution of "Mushoku Tensei" is its focus on complex character development. The protagonist, Rudeus Greyrat, is introduced as a deeply flawed individual, burdened with the failures and traumas of his past life. His journey of self-improvement and redemption is central to the story, offering a more nuanced and psychologically complex lead than typically seen in earlier isekai works. This emphasis on a flawed, yet relatable protagonist has influenced many modern isekai narratives, encouraging deeper exploration of character arcs.
            
            Furthermore, the series invests heavily in its supporting characters, each with their own unique backgrounds, motivations, and development arcs. This approach enriches the narrative, creating a tapestry of interwoven stories that enhance the overall plot. The depth given to these characters allows for a more engaging and dynamic story, as each character contributes meaningfully to the protagonist's journey and the world around them.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font">Impact on the Genre's Popularity</h3>
            <p class="font">"Mushoku Tensei" also played a critical role in revitalizing the isekai genre. When it was first published as a web novel in 2012, it came at a time when the genre was gaining momentum but had not yet reached the heights of popularity it enjoys today. The success of "Mushoku Tensei" helped propel isekai into the mainstream, inspiring a wave of similar stories and contributing to the genre's boom. The anime adaptation further solidified its influence, reaching a broader audience and showcasing the potential of isekai narratives in modern anime.
            </p>
            <p class="font">In summary, "Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation" is considered the first modern isekai anime due to its pioneering role in popularizing new tropes, its high standards of world-building and character development, and its significant impact on the genre's popularity. By introducing a fresh take on the reincarnation premise, developing a richly detailed world, and focusing on complex character arcs, it set a new benchmark for isekai stories and inspired many subsequent works, shaping the genre into what it is today.</p>

        <p class="font">Rudeus Greyrat (ルーデウス・グレイラット Rūdeusu Gureiratto) is the main protagonist of Mushoku Tensei. He was an overweight 34-year-old Japanese NEET who is reincarnated into another world after being hit by a truck whilst saving some kids. Realizing he wasted away his previous life, he resolves to live this new one to its fullest and the series revolves around how he impacts his new world all whilst slowly growing out of his reclusive ways.</p>
        <details>
            <summary class="sumChar">Appearance</summary>
            <p class="font">Rudeus stands at around average height(175cm), has a muscular body despite being a magician, and his looks weren't that poor when his family members are asked. He was born with light brown hair and green eyes. However, he later has Kishirika Kishirisu switch out both of his original eyes for demon eyes, causing them to be heterochromatic. Like his father, Paul, Rudeus also has a mole underneath his left eye and follows his ponytail hairstyle.

                He is also always seen wearing gray robes but rarely covers his head during his time as an adventurer. At a young age, he is careless about the outfit he wears due to travelling the Demon Continent and has worn the same gray robes when he entered Ranoa Magic Academy that has many cuts and hems from his countless battles that makes him look like a delinquent. During his 20's he begins to pay more attention to the clothes he wears that even Perugius Dola mentions that he started to wear some decent clothes.[7]
                
                Following his second fight with Orsted and later the final battle against Hitogami's faction, Rudeus' hair temporarily lost its color from mana exhaustion. Fortunately, in both cases, the roots were unaffected, causing his hair to grow back to normal over time.</p>

        <details>
            <summary class="sumChar">Personality</summary>
            <p class="font">Because of his experience from his former life, Rudeus is careful not to get carried away and become arrogant. As a result, he is extremely self-aware and humble because he does not want to revert to his old self.[8][9] After reincarnation he is more willing to be kind, helping his friends and protecting his family whenever needed, where in the past he would have scoffed. Due to being considered a genius, who is capable in many fields at a young age, people have high expectations of him. Rudeus is also very polite to others, often making them uncomfortable especially to those who knows of his father's notorious reputation.

                Having the morals of his past life, he hesitates with the thought of killing someone. He also has a calm personality who never lets go of his smile no matter how much abuse or violence he went through but he displays aggression and blood lust to anyone threatening his family. As a descendant of the Notos Greyrat Family who likes pretty girls and big breasts, he is extremely perverted that he tends to touch his wives even in public but never makes a move on anyone other than his wives. He is also loyal to his friends that he always takes care of them to a great extent. As such, Rudeus is quite feared but is respected and loved by the people of Sharia and to some extent even the most famous or powerful beings of the Human World either fears or respect him.
                
                Apart from carelessness in his outfit, Rudeus also loves cleanliness that he remodeled one of the rooms of his house in Sharia to be a huge bathroom which is only made by the upper nobles of Human Kingdoms and he also bathes almost everyday.[7]
                
                Even with very high magic capacity and high potential in battle, he often lacks the confidence to fight his enemy and his legs trembles when confronted in battle[10] but manages to overcome this after surviving his first battle against Orsted whose killing intent is significantly intense compared to what he encountered afterwards even when fighting against a Red Dragon.[11] When facing a stronger opponent he knows he cannot defeat, he prefers to talk himself out of battles which also caused him to earn various titles related to this.[12]</p>

        <p class="font">Eris Greyrat (エリス・グレイラット Erisu Gureiratto), born Eris Boreas Greyrat (エリス・ボレアス・グレイラット Erisu Boreasu Gureiratto), is a noble girl and second cousin of Rudeus. She is a Character with a short temper but has potential in the Sword God Style.[4][5] During her journey to return home following the Teleport Incident, she grows to love Rudeus.</p>
        <details>
            <summary class="sumChar">Appearance</summary>
            <p class="font">She has long red hair, a nice figure, and swords around her waist on both the left and right sides.

                At the end of the Decisive Battle Chapter, she has streaks of white in her hair due to mana strain.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary class="sumChar">Personality</summary>
            <p class="font">Upon meeting Rudeus, Eris was contemptuous, impulsive, defiant, and condescending; she is also short tempered and prone to violent outbursts. It's implied that her attitude is a direct influence of her grandfather, Sauros.

                During her time with Rudeus, she still maintains her violent tendencies but has greatly changed after her tenth birthday and will resort to violence to anyone who holds negative emotions and/or intentions against Rudeus. However, despite the outer aggressiveness, Eris also has a high level of shyness, often hitting Rudeus for touching her suddenly even though she does the same to him. She and Rudeus have a mutual inferiority complex where both would assume the other is more wonderful than themselves, easily leading to misunderstandings which also causes her to leave Rudeus to go train in the Holy Land of Swords to be on equal standing with Rudeus.
                
                During her time on the Holy Land of Swords, Eris became taciturn and uncaring as she obsessively trains to become stronger while recalling the memories of her defeat from Orsted and the sight of Rudeus in a near dead state. She also does not interact nor talk with with almost anyone unless its a topic about Rudeus until she trains together with Nina and Isolte Cruel.[6]
                
                Eris gets excited easily on seeing things she have never seen before like the Migurd Village houses that uses giant turtle shells as roof tops in the Demon Continent.[7] When Eris enters the Chaos Breaker, she raises her voice in amazement upon seeing how small the village is from the sky causing Sylvaril to take an immediate liking to her upon seeing Eris' carefree smile and offers to guide her around the castle.[8]
                
                Originally, she had a tendency to constantly release blood lust, but she later controls it after years of training at the Holy Land of Swords. She is named the 'Mad Dog' or Mad Sword King due to her personality of bearing fangs at anyone for a period of time and is noted to be 'free'. She also has a high libido (she beat Rudeus in bed), often attacking Rudeus but it was later toned down after aging.</p>
